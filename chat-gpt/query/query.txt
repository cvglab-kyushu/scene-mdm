Given a sentence, predict the target object.
The sentence is about a character doing some kind of action. Assume that the character in the sentence is in a room with some furniture. The target object is the furniture that the character in the given sentence is interacting with. If the sentence does not contain any furniture or you think there is no target object, please answer none.

The types of furniture that are expected to be in the room are as the following list:
wall
floor
chair
door
table
picture
cabinet
cushion
window
sofa
bed
curtain
chest of drawers
plant
sink
stairs
ceiling
toilet
stool
towel
mirror
tv monitor
shower
column
bathtub
counter
fireplace
lighting
beam
railing
shelving
blinds
gym equipment
seating
board panel
furniture
appliances
clothes

Basically, furniture and objects other than this list will not be target objects. However, synonyms of these furniture or furniture with similar uses are target objects. e.g. dest(table), rug(floor), whiteboard(board panel). In that case, instead of answering with the word in the sentence, answer with the word in the list.

The format for the input sentence is as follows:

Your response needs to follow the format:
